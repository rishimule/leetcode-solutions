## Example Problem

### Problem: Sort the Jumbled Numbers problem in Python
- **Link**: [Sort the Jumbled Numbers problem in Python](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-jumbled-numbers/)  <!-- Link to the problem -->
- **Description**: You are given a 0-indexed integer array mapping which represents the mapping rule of a shuffled decimal system. mapping[i] = j means digit i should be mapped to digit j in this system. The mapped value of an integer is the new integer obtained by replacing each occurrence of digit i in the integer with mapping[i] for all 0 <= i <= 9. You are also given another integer array nums. Return the array nums sorted in non-decreasing order based on the mapped values of its elements. <!-- Description of the problem -->

#### Solution (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def sortJumbled(self, mapping: List[int], nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        def translate_integer(num: int) -> int:
            digits: list[str] = list(str(num))
            for i in range(len(digits)):
                digits[i] = str(mapping[int(digits[i])])
            return int("".join(digits))

        number_mapping: dict[int, int] = {}
        for num in nums:
            number_mapping[num] = translate_integer(num)
        nums.sort(key=lambda val: number_mapping[val])

        return nums
```

#### Usage
```python
mapping = [8,9,4,0,2,1,3,5,7,6]
nums = [991,338,38]

s = Solution()
output = s.sortJumbled(mapping, nums)

print(output)  # Output: [338, 38, 991]  <!-- Expected output -->
```
